Welcome to the Takahashi Group (情報化学研究室)!
We are a research group based out of the Department of Chemistry at Hokkaido University.
Takahashi Group focuses on the design of materials, catalysts, and chemical reactions in a combination of experiments, theory, computations, and data science.
We focus on research in four different areas: <b>Database Construction</b>, <b>Experiment & Calculation</b>, <b>Data Science</b>, and <b>Software Development</b>.
In doing so, our research helps develop aspects of four types of informatics: <b>Materials Informatics</b>・<b>Catalyst Informatics</b>・ <b>Measurement Informatics</b>・<b>Process Informatics</b>
